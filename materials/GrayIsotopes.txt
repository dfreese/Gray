# This file specifies the different isotopes that can be used by Gray.
# Currently, all of these are interpreted as positron emitters, but that could
# change in the future.  In this file, blank lines, and anything after a pound
# sign is ignored.  The first material is used as the default.

# The default acolinearity used for all isotopes currently is taken from
# "Annihilation photon acollinearity in PET: volunteer and phantom FDG studies"
# by Shibuya, Yoshida, Nishikido, et al. in 2007.  They present a blurring
# coefficient for a Pool Phantom Study in Table I of 2.48.  This can be
# converted to degrees by multiplying by 4 to get to radians (see eq. 13 for
# intuition), and then converting to degrees.

# Positron range information is taken from Levin and Hoffman in 1999.  The
# values have been updated since publication based on an update to the Monte
# Carlo code.  The values should follow from Table I.

# Half-life, gamma emission, and positron emission data was taken from the
# relevant volumes of "Table de Radionuclides," which can be accessed at
# http://www.nucleide.org/DDEP_WG/DDEPdata.htm

# There are six required fields:
#   - The name of the isotope
#   - Acolinearity in degrees FWHM.
#   - The half-life in seconds.  Zero indicates no half-life decay.
#   - The probability of emitting a positron after a nuclear decay.  Negative
#     probabilities and those greater than 1 are corrected to 1.
#   - The energy of a prompt gamma emitted with the positron in MeV.
#     0 indicates none.
#   - The positron range model
#
# There are three models to specify positron range
#   - none, no parameters required
#   - gauss, fwhm in mm and max range in mm required
#   - levin_exp, decay 1 prob (c), decay 1 length (k1), decay 2 length, max mm
